            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Fourthly, The ſeveral Congregations in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>being one Church, the Elders of that Church are mentioned as meeting together for acts of Government.</hi> Act. 11. 30. Which alſo they did and ſent it to the Elders by the hands of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul.</hi> Acts 15. 4, 6, 22. <hi>v.</hi> 4. And when they were come to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> they were received of the Church, and of the Apoſtles and Ellers, and they declared all things that God had done with them. <hi>v.</hi> 6.

Then it pleaſed the Apoſtles and Elders, with the whole Church, to ſend choſen men of their own company to <hi>Antioch</hi> with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> namely, <hi>Judas</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Barſabas,</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> chief men among the brethren. Acts 21. 17, 18. <hi>v.</hi> 17. And when they were come to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the brethren received us gladly: <hi>v.</hi> 18. And the day following <hi>Paul</hi> went in with us unto <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>all the Elders were preſent;</hi> and ſo forward: <hi>Which proves that thoſe ſeveral Congregations were under one Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Government.</hi>

               <head>The Directory for Ordination of Miniſters</head>
               <p>IT being manifeſt by the Word of God, that no man ought to take upon him the Office of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Goſpel, untill he be lawfully called and ordained thereunto: And that the work of Ordination is to be performed with all due care, wiſdome, gravity and ſolemnity, we humbly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe directions as requiſite to be obſerved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that is to be ordained, being either nominated by the people, or otherwiſe commended to the Presbytery for any place, muſt addreſſe himſelf to the Presbytery, and bring with him a Teſtimonial of his taking the Covenant of the three Kingdoms, of his diligence and proficiency in his Studies; What degrees he hath taken in the Univerſity, and what hath been the time of his abode there; and withal of his age, which is to be twenty four yeers, but eſpecially of his life and converſation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Which being conſidered by the Presbytery, they are to proceed, to enquire touching the Grace of God in him, and whether he be of ſuch holineſſe of life as is requiſite in a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and to examine him touching his learning and ſufficiency, and touching the evidences of his Calling to the holy Miniſtry, and in particular his fair and direct Calling to that place.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Rules for Examination are theſe.</head>
               <p>1. <hi>That the party examined be dealt withal in a brotherly way, with mildneſſe of ſpirit, and with ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reſpect to the gravity, modeſty, and quality of every one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>He ſhall be examined touching his skill in the Original Tongues, and his tryal to be made by reading the</hi> Hebrew <hi>and</hi> Greek Teſtaments, <hi>and rendring ſome portion of ſome into</hi> Latin; <hi>and if he be defective in them, enquiry ſhall be made the more ſtrictly after his other Learning, and whether he hath skill in</hi> Logick <hi>and</hi> Phyloſophy.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>What Authors in</hi> Divinity <hi>he hath read, and is beſt acquainted with, and triall ſhall be made in his knowledge of the grounds of Religion, and ability to defend the Orthodox Doctrine contained in them, againſt all unſound and erronious opinions, eſpecially theſe of the preſent age; of his skill in the ſenſe and meaning of ſuch places of Scripture as ſhall be propoſed unto him in caſes of Conſcience, and in the Chronology of the Scripture, and the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>If he hath not before preached in publique, with approbation of ſuch as are able to judge, he ſhall, at a competent time aſſigned him, expound before the Presbytery ſuch a place of Scripture as ſhall be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. <hi>He ſhall alſo, within a competent time frame a diſcourſe in</hi> Latin <hi>upon ſuch a common place or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie in Divinity as ſhall be aſſigned him, and exhibite to the Presbytery ſuch Theſes as expreſſe the ſum thereof, and maintain a Diſpute upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. <hi>He ſhall preach before the people, the Presbytery, or ſome of the Miniſters of the Word appointed by them, being preſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. <hi>The proportion of his gifts in relation to the place unto which he is called, ſhall be conſidered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. <hi>Beſide the trial of his gifts in Preaching, he ſhall undergo an examination in the Premiſes two ſeveral dayes, and more, if the Presbytery ſhall judge it neceſſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. <hi>And as for him that hath been formerly ordained a Miniſter, and is to be removed to another Charge, he ſhall bring a Teſtimonial of his Ordination, and of his abilities and Converſation, whereupon his fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for that place ſhall be tryed by his Preaching there, (if it ſhall be judged neceſſary) by a further exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. In all which he being approved, he is to be ſent to the Church where he is to ſerve, there to preach three ſeveral days,, and to converſe with the people, that they may have tryal of his gifts for their edification, and may have time and occaſion to enquire into, and the better to know his life and converſation.</p>
               <p>4. In the laſt of theſe three dayes, appointed for the tryal of his gifts in preaching, there ſhall be ſent from the Presbytery to the Congregation, a publike intimation in writing, which ſhall be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely read before the people; and after affixed to the Church door, to ſignifie, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>5. Upon the day appointed for Ordination, which is to be performed in that Church, where he that is to be ordained is to ſerve, a ſolemn Faſt ſhall be kept by the Congregation, that they may the more earneſtly joyn in Prayer for a bleſſing upon the Ordinance of Chriſt, and the labours of his Servant for their good. The Presbytery ſhall come to the place, or at leaſt three or four Miniſters of the Word ſhall be ſent thither from the Presbytery of which one appointed by the Presbytery, ſhall preach to the People, concerning the office and du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y of Miniſters of Chriſt, and how the People ought to receive them for their work ſake.</p>
               <p>6. After the Sermon, the Miniſter who hath preached, ſhall in the face of the Congregation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of him who is now to be ordained concerning his faith in Chriſt Jeſus, and his perſwaſion of the truth of the Reformed Religion according to the Scripture; His ſincere intentions and ends in deſiring to enter into this Calling; His diligence in Praying, Reading, Meditation, Preaching, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the Sacraments, Diſcipline and doing all Miniſterial Duties towards his Charge; His Zeal and Faithfulneſſe in maintaining the Truth of the Goſpel, and Unity of the Church againſt Error and Schiſm; His care that himſelf and his Family may be unblameable and examples to the Flock; His willingneſſe and humility in meekneſſe of Spirit, to ſubmit unto the admonitions of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and Diſcipline of the Church; And his reſolution to continue in his duty againſt all trouble and perſecution</p>
               <p>7. In all which having declared himſelf, profeſſed his willingneſſe, and promiſed his endeavours by the help of God; The Miniſter likewiſe ſhall demand of the people, concerning their willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to receive and acknowledge him as the Miniſter of Chriſt, and to obey and ſubmit unto him, as having rule over them in the Lord, and to maintaine, encourage and aſſiſt him in all the parts of his Office.</p>
               <p>Which being mutually promiſed by the people, the Presbytery, or the Miniſters ſent from them for Ordination, ſhall ſolemnly ſet him apart to the Office and work of the Miniſtry, by laying their hands on him, which is to be accompanied with a ſhort Prayer or Bleſſing, to this effect</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Thankfully acknowledging the great mercy of God, in ſending Jeſus Chriſt for the redemption of his people, and for his aſcenſion to the right hand of God the Father, and thence pouring out his Spirit, and giving gifts to Men, Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Prophets, Paſtors and Teachers, for the gathering and building up of his Church, and for fitting and inclining this man to this great work; To entreat him to fit him with his holy Spirit, to give him (who in his name we thus ſet apart to this holy ſervice) to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Work of his Miniſtry in all things, that he may both ſave himſelf and his people committed to his charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. This or the like form of Prayer and Bleſſing being ended, let the Miniſter who preached, briefly exhort him to conſider of the greatneſſe of his Office and Work, the danger of negligence both to himſelf and his people, the bleſſing which will accompany his faithfulneſſe in this life, and that to come; and withall exhort the people to carry themſelvs to him as to their Miniſter in the Lord, according to their ſolemn promiſe made before; and ſo by Prayer commending both him and his Flock to the Grace of God, after ſinging of a Pſalm, let the Aſſembly be diſmiſſed with a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
               <p>10. If a Miniſter be deſigned to a Congregation, who hath been formerly ordained Presbyter according to the form of Ordination which hath been in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which we hold for ſubſtance to be valid, and not to be diſclaimed by any who have received it; Then there being a cautious proceeding in matters of Examination, let him be admitted without any new Ordination.</p>
               <p>11. And in caſe any Perſon already ordained Miniſter in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or in any other reformed Church, be deſigned to a Congregation in <hi>England,</hi> he is to bring from the Church to that Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery here, within which that Congregation is, a ſufficient teſtimonial of his Ordination, of his life and converſation while he lived with them, and of the cauſes of his removal; And to undergo ſuch a tryal of his fitneſſe and ſufficiency, and to have the ſame courſe held with him, in other particulars, as is ſet down in the rule immediately going before touching Examination and Admiſſion.</p>
               <p>12. That Records be carefully kept in the ſeveral Presbyteries, of the names of the Perſons ordained,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:167028:112"/> with their teſtimonials, the time and place of their Ordination, of the Presbyters who did impoſe hands upon them, and of the charge to which they are appointed.</p>
               <p>13. That no money or gift, of what kind ſoever, ſhall be received from the Perſon to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, or from any on his behalf, for Ordination, or ought elſe belonging to it, by any of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, or any appertaining to any of them, upon what pretence ſoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus far of ordinary rules and courſe of Ordination in the ordinary way; That which concernes the extraordinary way, requiſite to be now practiſed, followeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In theſe preſent exigencies, while we cannot have any Presbyteries formed up to their whole power and work, and that many Miniſters are to be ordained for the ſervice of the Armies and Navy, and too many Congregations where there is no Miniſter at all; and where (by reaſon of the publike troubles) the people cannot either themſelves enquire out and finde out one who may be a faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter for them, or have any with ſafety ſent unto them for ſuch a ſolemn tryal as was before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ordinary Rules, eſpecially when there can be no Presbytery neer unto them, to whom they may addreſſe themſelves, or which may come or ſend to them a fit man to be ordained in that Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and for that people; And yet notwithſtanding, it is requiſite that Miniſters be ordained for them, by ſome; who being ſet apart themſelves for the work of the Miniſtry, have power to joyn in the ſetting apart of others, who are found fit and worthy. In thoſe caſes, untill by Gods bleſſing the aforeſaid difficulties may be in ſome good meaſure removed; let ſome godly Miniſter in or about the City of <hi>London,</hi> be deſigned by publike authority; who being aſſociated, may ordain Miniſters for the City, and the Vicinity, keeping as neer to the ordinary Rules forementioned, as poſſible they may; And let this aſſociation be for no other intent or purpoſe, but only for the work of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let the like aſſociation be made by the ſame authority in great Towns, and the neighbouring Pariſhes in the ſeveral Counties, which are at the preſent quiet and undiſturbed, to do the like for the parts adjacent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let ſuch as are choſen or appointed for the ſervice of the Armies or Navy be ordained, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, by the aſſociated Miniſters of <hi>London,</hi> or ſome others in the countrey.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let them do the like, when any man ſhall duly and lawfully be recommended to them for the Miniſtry of any Congregation, who cannot enjoy liberty to have a tryal of his parts and abilities, and deſire the help of ſuch Miniſters ſo aſſociated, for the better furniſhing of them with ſuch a Perſon, as by them ſhall be judged fit for the ſervice of that Church and People.</p>
